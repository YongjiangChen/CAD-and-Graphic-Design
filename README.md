- AI is increasingly impacting the creative industry. AI tools are capable of creating art, music, and written content at a level that challenges the traditional role of human creators. In some areas, particularly those involving repetitive or pattern-based tasks, AI can perform more efficiently than humans. This shift could lead to a decline in demand for certain traditional skills, pushing creatives to adapt and integrate AI into their workflows.
